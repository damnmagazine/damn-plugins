While Google Wallet is quite functional, it currently lacks some of the advanced features that you\'ll find with PayPal Pro or Authorize.Net. Please keep this in mind as you work through the integration below.</p>'."\n";
			echo '<p><strong>Customer Privacy...</strong> Google has been under scrutiny for privacy issues over the last couple years. As a result, Google has become very strict about what its system will share with merchants offering Google Wallet as a form of payment. For instance, Google Wallet currently provides no way for you (thus, s2Member) to receive a customer\'s email address or name after checkout. Google expects that your site will have already collected this information before checkout begins.</p>'."\n";
			echo '<p>For this reason, s2Member recommends that Google Wallet Buttons be presented only to an existing user of your site; this way the checkout process will be smoother for a customer. We suggest that you enable Open Registration under <strong>Dashboard → s2Member → General Options</strong>. Allow a visitor to register for free (first), and THEN introduce a Google Wallet Button so they can upgrade to a higher Membership Level or purchase Custom Capabilities that you offer. This will provide the best customer experience when dealing with Google Wallet as a form of payment. In this scenario, you (thus, s2Member) will already have the customer\'s email address, so there is no reason for s2Member to add an additional step during checkout.</p>'."\n";
			echo '<p>However, this is only a suggestion. Google Wallet Buttons generated by s2Member CAN be introduced to users who are NOT logged-in also (in this case the customer is prompted for their email address before they reach Google Wallet and checkout begins). This can sometimes be confusing to a customer though, because the customer might be asked for their email address AGAIN when they reach the checkout page at Google. Please try to avoid this scenario when possible.</p>'."\n";
